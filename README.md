# BIGAN_Improved

This repository is for the improved BiGAN which can be used for simulation and prediction of sequence dataset with relatively high performance. The experiment dataset is 1-Month-USD Libor. The discovery is accepted by IEEE EIDWT 2020 and published in "Advances in Internet, Data and Web Technologies" pp 440-447:https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-39746-3_45.The copyright is authorized to IEEE.

Before i wrote a failed one and after some time i wrote this one which is proven to be workable for forecasting time series dataset.

i removed the optimizer part and believe the original one is good enough. but if you want to add the optimizer you can add it.

You can download the libor data from website and run "experiment.py" to test.
